     Structured in the TF-KDS-agreed THREE stages: (1) the overarching data
     protection concept, (2) DIMP in the data portal, (3) the
     module-specific aspects. Gate review selected the documented default for
     stage 3 because the source guide states no module-specific aspects.

This section addresses security and privacy experts. General requirements are in
the FHIR core specification —
[Security & Privacy Module](https://build.fhir.org/secpriv-module.html) and the
[security checklist](https://build.fhir.org/security.html). This page does not
repeat them; it links the overarching data protection framework and states what is
**specific to this module**.

#### 1. The overarching data protection concept

The
[overarching data protection concept of the Medical Informatics Initiative](https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/en/data-protection-concept)
governs how patient data may be processed for research across the network of
Data Integration Centers: it
covers the legal basis (the MII Broad Consent), the roles of the Data
Integration Centers and Use & Access Committees, and the cross-site application
scenarios (feasibility queries, distributed analyses, data and biosample
provision). Everything this module specifies operates inside that framework —
this guide adds no processing purpose of its own.

#### 2. De-identification, minimisation and pseudonymisation (DIMP)

How data leaving a Data Integration Center is de-identified in practice is
specified by
[DIMP (De-Identification — Minimisation — Pseudonymisation)](https://medizininformatik-initiative.github.io/dataportal/data-node/DIMP.html)
in the data portal documentation: direct identifiers are removed,
data elements not needed by the approved project are dropped, and identifying
values are replaced by project-specific pseudonyms (FHIR Pseudonymizer
configuration). The profiles of this module describe data *before* DIMP is
applied; which elements survive a concrete data release is decided per project
by the DIMP configuration, not by this guide.

#### 3. Module-specific aspects

> Beyond the overarching framework above — the overarching data protection
> concept, the Broad Consent it rests on, and DIMP — this module carries no
> data category that raises security or privacy aspects of its own, and it
> places no module-specific security or privacy requirements on implementers.
